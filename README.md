## Overview of Analysis
Before opening a surf and ice cream shop, I needed to help my partner W. Avy with some analysis on temperatures and precipitation throughout the year.  To see if the business is viable, we need to find out if the weather is good enough to sustain sales year-round.

## Results
Three key differences in weather between June and December:

1.  The average temperature is almost four degrees cooler in December than in June
2.  December temperatures can get almost ten degrees cooler on the coldest days, with 56 degrees Fahrenheit as the low.
3.  The Maximum temperature for both months is between 83-85 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Summary

There are many additional queries that could be performed, but the ones that I would be most interested in would be precipitation between June and December, as well as additional station data.  

- After performing the precipitation query, I discovered that the average rainfall differs by about 7-8%.  This tells me that there is not a significant difference that would affect sales between June and December.
- Upon performing a query to compare the data from various stations, I can say with confidence that the data is accurate and reliable.  This is important when deciding to open the shop, as inaccurate data could lead to a poor decision on whether or not to open the surf and ice cream shop.  

I would recommend opening the shop and think that the business is very viable.
